1. How do I approach designing software?
    What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
    What design process did you follow for your project work?
    How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
2. How do I approach developing programs?
    What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
    How did iteration factor into your development?
    How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
3. How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
    How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
    
1. Designing software for this class was tricky for me, as I had minimal experience with OpenGL before, I had to put in extra work to make sure that it worked out the way I wanted to. Since OpenGL was new to me, and some of the requirements were tricky I broke down what each requirement was really asking, and thought about what I had to do to to achieve that functionality. Being able to recognize what I needed to do, and thinking about how I needed to do it is something that I can carry forward for future projects.
    
2. I approached developing this software modularly, working on one part at a time until it was satisfactory and moving on to the next. After every module going back to ensure that no new bugs came up with the completion of another block of code. This class helped me better plan out how and what I break down to work on individually, as there were many complex requirements that I had to break down more than I normally would. This adapatation is one of the ideas that will help me in my future work, as well as a continually evolving time management system.

3. Since I am persuing a degree in computer science, it is extremely important. Being knowledgable in the field, knowing best practices, and being familiar with systems and design all all crucial for any development, or even managerial work in the field. Besides that, for OpenGL specifically, being familiar with the system opens up jobs that use computational graphics for gaming, or displaying information to users for other means. Knowing OpenGL gives an advantage of knowledge and familiarity that others may not have and need to rely on.
